<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alamu Oluwaseun Emmanuel. I am in my second year in the university and just starting off my coding journey.</p>

<p>I believe in Jesus and I love Him. He only can make a man attain fulfillment, nothing else. Anything outside of him, no matter beautiful or glorious it may look, it is Vanity.</p>

<p>I believe in doing your best but my definition of the best can always be improved.</p>
